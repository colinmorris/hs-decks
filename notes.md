Interesting things to do with the data:

- Map decks to some 2-d space just based on similarity of composition
- Detect clusters of similar decks automatically
- Visualize shifts in deck composition over time (TODO: maybe need to control for expansions)
- Visualize the relationships between individual cards based on their co-occurrence
